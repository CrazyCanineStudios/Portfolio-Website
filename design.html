			<!-- Game Overview -->
			<h2 style="padding-top: 25px; font-size: 50px;">Game Overview</h2>

			<!-- Game Inspiration-->
			<div class="inner" style="background-color: #15224e;padding: 2em 0 2em 0;">
				<h2 style="padding-top: 25px; font-size: 50px;">Game Inspiration</h2>
				<p>The game draws inspiration from games such as "The Binding of Isaac", "Don't Starve Together" and "Zombies Ate My Neighbors".<br> These games all feature similar gameplay mechanics and a cartoony visual style</p>
				<img src="images/game_inspiration.png">
				<p>The control scheme of this game has been influenced by The Binding of Isaac; which utilises simple directional controls for moving <br>and shooting, with dedicated keys for activating abilities or using items.</p>
				<p>Player 1 can use the W,A,S,D Keys to move and the spacebar to shoot. <br>Player 2 can use the arrow keys to move and the numPad 0 button to shoot</p>

			<div class="inner" style="padding: 2em 0 2em 0;">
				<h2 style="padding-top: 25px; font-size: 50px;">User Interface</h2>

			<!-- Level Design -->
			<div class="inner" style="background-color: #15224e;padding: 2em 0 2em 0;">
					<h2 style="padding-top: 25px; font-size: 50px;">level Design</h2>
					<p>The level uses a linear topology. The objective is to reach and defeat the final boss (located at point B). The player(s) will start at point A.<br> The level is designed to represent a large house, with assets and obstacles being in the forms of furniture found within a modern house. </p>
					<img src="images/levelLayout.png">
				<p>Starting in Harry's bedroom, the player(s) will progress through the house facing basic enemies such as the dangerous clowns and giant monster teddy bears. <br>Later on, they will navigate down a flight of stairs to a hallway with slightly tougher enemies and obstacles. <br>The player(s) will eventually find the living room which will be a larger fighting area featuring multiple enemies and larger obstacles and lead towards the final boss. </p>

			<!-- Added Features -->
			<div class="inner" style="padding: 2em 0 2em 0;">
				<h2 style="padding-top: 25px; font-size: 50px;">Added Features</h2>
				<p>The game changed throughout its development and many new features absent from the design document were added to improve the overall game experience</p>
				<li>Team Lives were added - this allows the player multiple attempts at reaching the goal and encourages team play as they share lives.</li>
				<li>The story was expanded - this helps to invest the player in the game's world and story and give them a reason to want to progress.</li>
				<li>Ammo and Health Pickups - ammo and health pick ups will randomly drop from defeated enemies, making it easier for a player to complete a level</li>
				<li>A game over and win screen were added that allows the player to win or lose the game</li>
				<img style="padding-top: 25px;" src="images/gameOver.png">
				<p>The game design document has been updated to include more detail on these new features as well as features that did not make it into the final game.</p>
